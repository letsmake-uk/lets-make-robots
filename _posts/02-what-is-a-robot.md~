## So what exactly is a robot?


From Wikipedia:
"A robot is a mechanical or virtual artificial agent, usually an electro-mechanical machine that is guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry."


That's super general right! This definition encompasses so much of the day-to-day technology we come into contact with, as well the stuff of movies - from artificial intelligences bent on world domination to 'spam bots' that send you junk mail, and from multi-million dollar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1czBcnX1Ww">BigDogs</a> to the timer on your toasting machine.


During this course we'll be focussing on controlling mechanical and electronic components using a small computer 'brain' called the <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a>. We'll be looking at how electronic circuits and computers really work, as well as how our own custom parts can be manufactured using a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing">3D printing</a>.
